# Topology_in_Lean_Project_6_Compactness

The goal of this project is to prove Heine-Borel and the extreme value theorem in Lean 4.

```
Heine Borel
Subsets of R^n are compact iff they are closed and bounded.
```

```
Corollary (Extreme value theorem):
f : R^n -> R continuous and K is a compact subset of R^n then
exists x_min and x_max in K s.t. for any y in K f(x_min) <= f(y) <= f(x_max)
```


## Definitions
The folder Definitions contains all the definitions and theorems introduced and proved in Class.
